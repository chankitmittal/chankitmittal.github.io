#Experience

ZF Technical Centre India Pvt Ltd
Projects: Steer by Wire, Integrated Brake Control, Electronic Stability Control

- Coordinated and performed testing activities for Bootloader (SW download), Fault cycle tests with Diagnostic & Comms Failsafe with CAPL and led 3 engineers in the Steer-By-Wire project.

- Spearheaded development of scripts using Python for E2E testing for Comms Fault handling for HIL, automating test generation & specifications, reducing testing time by 80%.

- Developed a Python-based solution for auto-generating OBD fault-handling tests based on OBD type for HIL & Test Suite creation, resulting in a 70% reduction in time.

- Built a Python-based tool for auto-generating HIL & CAPL-based tests & specifications for vehicle comms Rx testing, leveraging Customer document (*.arxml/*.dbc) & Rx/Tx Interface list, reducing test development and execution time by 75%.

- Implemented a UDS-based flashing script using a keyword-driven approach to perform positive and negative testing for the Appl SW download using Canoe.

- Executed tests for NVRAM and State Management in standalone benches.

- Implemented a Python script to extract data from DIVA test reports and automatically import them into Rational DOORS, reducing manual effort by 80%.

- Established & maintained Test environments for braking and steering products and led the adoption of a new remote desktop connection approach, boosting efficiency by 20%.

- Prepared user manuals, concept slides for automation tools, provided training sessions to over 15+ engineers, updated test strategies based on features and projects.

- Involved in technical support to the team during testing activities. Additionally, visited Koblenz, Germany, for two months to support project activities.

AVL Technical Centre India Pvt Ltd
Projects: Battery Management System, Inverter

- Designed test suites for 10+ components based on SW requirements & unit design in SWE.4.

- Manually created 100+ test cases using White box & black box testing techniques, focusing on Safety levels for SIL & PIL-based test environments for Basic SW components.

- Executed Manual, automated, regression testing in VectorCAST, reviewing unit test artifacts for correctness based on the test Strategy, reduced overall time by 25%.

- Trained team members in VectorCAST and test management process for non-model-based development, improved 20% team efficiency.

- Upgraded liquid template scripts for Test generation, resulting in 30% less testing time.

- Achieved 100% assessment in Software Unit Verification (SWE.4) for ASPICE L2 Audit and meeting global team management goals.

- Collaborated with the teams to propose process improvement, documented user manuals, & lessons learnt during defects resolution, contributed to 20% increase in team efficiency.

- Provided on-site training for 3 Months at AVL Software & Functions, Germany.
